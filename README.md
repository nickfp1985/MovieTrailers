# Movie Trailer Project
This project is server-side **Python** code to store a list of movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. Then the code generates a static web page allowing visitors to browse the movies and watch the trailers.

The goal of this project is to learn how to write an application using object-oriented Python to make this application serve HTML via a web server, establish a foundation in core programming concepts using Python, and to understand the role a simple web server has in receiving a request, executing a block of code and generating a response.

## Documentation
This project follows the Python [Pep-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide.

The **fresh_tomatoes.py** module has a function called **open_movies_page** that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of the favorite movies.
